I'll provide a comprehensive plan for removing the sign-in and sign-up pages while retaining the forgot-password functionality. Here's the implementation plan:

# Implementation Plan: Removing Sign-in/Sign-up Pages While Retaining Forgot Password

## 1. Update Navigation and References

### A. Fix Main Page CTA Button
- Modify the "Get Started Today" button in `app/page.tsx` to open the auth modal instead of navigating to `/signup`
- Replace the direct link with a client-side component that triggers the auth modal

### B. Update Internal References
- Ensure all components that might link to `/sign-in` or `/sign-up` are updated to use the modal approach instead

## 2. Retain Forgot Password Functionality

### A. Keep Forgot Password Page
- Retain the entire `app/(auth-pages)/forgot-password` directory and its contents
- Keep the `smtp-message.tsx` component which is used by the forgot password page

### B. Update Auth Modal Links
- Ensure the "Forgot Password?" links in both auth modal components continue to point to the `/forgot-password` page
- Verify that the user experience flows smoothly from modal to forgot password page

## 3. Remove Unused Auth Pages

### A. Remove Sign-in Page
- Delete the `app/(auth-pages)/sign-in` directory and its contents

### B. Remove Sign-up Page
- Delete the `app/(auth-pages)/sign-up` directory and its contents

## 4. Update Layout for Forgot Password

### A. Modify Auth Pages Layout
- Update `app/(auth-pages)/layout.tsx` to only handle the forgot password page
- Simplify the layout if it contained specific elements for sign-in/sign-up pages

## 5. Update Routing and Redirects

### A. Add Redirects for Old URLs
- Implement redirects for `/sign-in` and `/sign-up` URLs to the homepage with the appropriate modal open
- This ensures that any bookmarked links or external references continue to work

## 6. Testing Plan

### A. Functional Testing
- Test the auth modals for sign-in and sign-up functionality
- Verify the forgot password flow works correctly
- Test the redirects from old URLs

### B. Edge Cases
- Test what happens when a user is directed to `/sign-in` or `/sign-up` from an external link
- Verify that deep links to these pages are properly handled

## 7. Documentation Updates

### A. Update Internal Documentation
- Document the change in authentication approach
- Note that only forgot password remains as a standalone page

### B. User-Facing Updates
- Update any user documentation or help content that might reference the standalone sign-in or sign-up pages

## Implementation Notes

1. The auth modals should be the primary entry point for authentication
2. The forgot password page should remain a standalone page since it often involves email verification flows
3. Consider adding state management to open the appropriate modal when redirecting from old URLs
4. Ensure the layout for the forgot password page is appropriate as a standalone page

This plan provides a structured approach to removing the sign-in and sign-up pages while maintaining the forgot password functionality, ensuring a smooth user experience throughout the transition.
